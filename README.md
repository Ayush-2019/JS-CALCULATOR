# JS-CALCULATOR

This is a javascript calculator that can do various arithmetic operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide as well as perform  trigonometric functions like sine,  cos, tan .This also contains feature to erase recent number or entry and delete whole input . I have also used "onkeyup"  event to get the answer using Enter key .
